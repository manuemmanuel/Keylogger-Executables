# Keylogger

This Keylogger is a simple Python script compiled into an executable file that runs in the background and records keystrokes made by the user. It captures keystrokes without the user's knowledge and stores them in a log file for later retrieval.

## Features

- **Stealth Mode**: The keylogger operates silently in the background without any indication to the user.
- **Keystroke Logging**: Records all keystrokes typed by the user, including special characters and key combinations.
- **Automatic Startup**: Configured to start automatically when the system boots up, ensuring continuous operation.
- **Customizable Logging**: Allows customization of the log file path and format for easy management and analysis.

## Usage

1. **Download the Executable**:

   Download the executable file (`keylogger.exe`) from the provided link.

2. **Run the Executable**:

   Double-click on the `keylogger.exe` file to run it. The keylogger will start automatically and run in the background without any visible interface.

3. **Record Keystrokes**:

   As the user types on the keyboard, the keylogger will silently capture and record all keystrokes.

4. **Retrieve Logs**:

   Access the log file generated by the keylogger to view the recorded keystrokes. By default, the log file is named `keystrokes.log` and located in the same directory as the executable.

5. **Stop and Exit**:

   To stop the keylogger and exit the program, right-click on the system tray icon (if available) or use the task manager to terminate the process.

## Important Notes

- **Legal Considerations**: Ensure compliance with local laws and regulations before using this keylogger. Unauthorized monitoring of computer activity may violate privacy laws.
- **Security Risks**: Exercise caution when using or distributing keyloggers, as they can be exploited for malicious purposes if misused or installed without consent.
- **Use Responsibly**: Keyloggers should only be used for legitimate purposes such as parental control, employee monitoring (with proper consent), or personal backup of typed text.
